        <h2>What Software Testing Offers</h2>
        <p>Software Testing is a critical process in the software development lifecycle that ensures the quality, functionality, and security of a product. It involves systematically identifying and fixing bugs, as well as verifying that the software meets the requirements set by the client or stakeholders. Here's what a comprehensive Software Testing course covers:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Manual Testing:</strong> Learn the fundamentals of testing software manually by executing test cases, identifying bugs, and ensuring the system behaves as expected.</li>
            <li><strong>Automation Testing:</strong> Master the use of tools like Selenium, JUnit, and TestNG to automate repetitive tests and increase efficiency.</li>
            <li><strong>Test Planning:</strong> Understand how to create detailed test plans, test cases, and test scripts that guide the testing process.</li>
            <li><strong>Functional Testing:</strong> Focus on verifying that all features of the application work according to the specified requirements.</li>
            <li><strong>Non-functional Testing:</strong> Gain insights into performance testing, security testing, and usability testing to ensure the software is robust, scalable, and user-friendly.</li>
            <li><strong>Defect Management:</strong> Learn how to report, track, and manage bugs using tools like Jira, Bugzilla, or Redmine.</li>
            <li><strong>Agile Testing:</strong> Understand how to implement testing processes within Agile development methodologies, emphasizing continuous testing and collaboration.</li>
            <li><strong>Test Automation Frameworks:</strong> Learn to develop and use frameworks like Data-Driven, Keyword-Driven, and Hybrid frameworks to streamline testing efforts.</li>
